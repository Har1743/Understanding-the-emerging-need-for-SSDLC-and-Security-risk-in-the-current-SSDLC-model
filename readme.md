# Abstract

The Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC) is an organized procedure that tries to produce high-quality, 
inexpensive software as quickly as feasible. Over time, other SDLC models have been created, from the waterfall 
and iterative to, more recently, the agile model. With each new model, deployment has tended to happen more quickly 
and frequently. Secure SSDLC has added security testing at each software development stage, from design to development, 
to deployment and beyond. You must make sure that you
are developing with potential vulnerabilities in mind at every stage
since anyone might probably have access to your source code. So
due to this Secure Software Development Life Cycle is so essential
and showcasing the emerging need.Despite the benefits of utilizing
Secure SDLC, organizations continue to have security challenges. A
pressing need for a secure development lifecycle has resulted from
this due to non-adaption of SSDLC and improper security practices
implementation in the current SSDLC. With this in mind, we researched the factors contributing to the growing demand followed
by discussing the discrepancies between the actual implementation
of the secure development lifecycle and expectations. As a result,
we eventually came up with a technique to fix the present SSDLC
modelâ€™s security problem.
