# Research Paper on Understanding the emerging need for SSDLC and Security risk in the current SSDLC model


# Abstract

The Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC) is an organized procedure that tries to produce high-quality, 
inexpensive software as quickly as feasible. Over time, other SDLC models have been created, from the waterfall 
and iterative to, more recently, the agile model. With each new model, deployment has tended to happen more quickly 
and frequently. Secure SSDLC has added security testing at each software development stage, from design to development, 
to deployment and beyond. You must make sure that you
are developing with potential vulnerabilities in mind at every stage
since anyone might probably have access to your source code. So
due to this Secure Software Development Life Cycle is so essential
and showcasing the emerging need.Despite the benefits of utilizing
Secure SDLC, organizations continue to have security challenges. A
pressing need for a secure development lifecycle has resulted from
this due to non-adaption of SSDLC and improper security practices
implementation in the current SSDLC. With this in mind, we researched the factors contributing to the growing demand followed
by discussing the discrepancies between the actual implementation
of the secure development lifecycle and expectations. As a result,
we eventually came up with a technique to fix the present SSDLC
model’s security problem.

# Conclusion

We used passive methodologies to examine the significance and
growing demand for Secure Software development lifecycles in
a variety of enterprises throughout the globe. With the help of
machine learning libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib as well as the
Log4j - 0-day vulnerability example, it is vital to reduce the impact
and necessity of SDLC. We made sure to underline the SDLC’s
constraints and the discrepancy between reality and expectations
checks in addition to the graphics. It also covered how organizations
adopted the SDLC early on and how they still use it now, as well
as the difficulties they face in doing so. We studied the current
SDLC models and found a new idea of security that is lacking in
businesses. We will make a theoretical attempt to put this strategy
into practice to increase the security of the organization, but none
has yet done so using the SDLC paradigm. We also talked about
the lack of emphasis given to security issues in most organizations
and the challenges businesses and developers face when putting
the SDLC into practice
